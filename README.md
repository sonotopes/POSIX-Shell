Command line shell implemented in C with POSIX functionality. Developed using the UNIX API. 

Functionality includes signal handling, I/O redirection, cd, unset, exit, and more. 
Job handling is established using simple foreground and background commands. Shell also includes the feature to use filename redirection operands. Pipelining is also established.
